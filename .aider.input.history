+fix the About section in the code. the current behavior: the image(me.jpg) is going below the profile-bg on big screen when it shouldn't it should only go outside to the left and up. andon small screen text and the `social-media-icons` are going out of the box too. the expected behavior is on big screen to have the image outside the boarder to left and up a bit and on smal screen to have the phto just up out of the boarder but not to the left and have the text only on small screen to be all under the photo except of the h1.lastname and h1.firstname 

# 2024-07-29 16:24:17.370750
+on small screen let's edit the behaviour, I want the ratio  to be kind of the same as the one on big screen, also the there should be space on top of the image.

# 2024-07-29 16:25:31.437721
+I need the image to go verticlly even on small screen . but to far left wihout corrsong the border

# 2024-07-29 16:27:54.181799
+on small screen it shouldnt go out of the profile-bg except for the top so no crossing the left or the right boarder of profile-bg

# 2024-07-29 16:29:33.439049
+on small screen the icons of social media are crossing the boarder towrads the bottom, make the box flexible so they want be out the box
